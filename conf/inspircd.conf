#   This is where you can configure which connections are allowed     #
#   and denied access onto your server. The password is optional.     #
#   You may have as many of these as you require. To allow/deny all   #
#   connections, use a '*' or 0.0.0.0/0.                              #
#                                                                     #
#  -- It is important to note that connect tags are read from the  -- #
#     TOP DOWN. This means that you should have more specific deny    #
#    and allow tags at the top, progressively more general, followed  #
#        by a <connect allow="*" (should you wish to have one).       #
#                                                                     #
# Connect blocks are searched twice for each user - once when the TCP #
# connection is accepted, and once when the user completes their      #
# registration. Most of the information (hostname, ident response,    #
# password, SSL when using STARTTLS, etc) is only available during    #
# the second search, so if you are trying to make a closed server,    #
# you will probably need a connect block just for user registration.  #
# This can be done by using <connect registered="no">                 #

# This tag is optional, and specifies one or more features which are  #

# Note that any disabled commands take effect only after the user has #
# 'registered' (e.g. after the initial USER/NICK/PASS on connection)  #
# so for example disabling NICK will not cripple your network.        #
